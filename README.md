# glencliffonline
This is a project built by the students at Glencliff HS.  They designed and developed the front end of the site.  We used Laravel to do the heavy lifting on the backend.  
We are proud of this, our first real web design and development project.  We hope you can make suggestions for how this site can be more efficient and enjoyable for the user.
